## Socket.io Basics 📻

### The Walkie-Talkie System
Imagine a classroom where everyone has magic walkie-talkies:

### Core Methods
| Method | What It Does | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `io.on('connection')` | 👋 New friend joins | `io.on('connection', (socket) => {})` |
| `socket.on()` | 👂 Listen for messages | `socket.on('message', callback)` |
| `socket.emit()` | 📨 Send to one person | `socket.emit('hi', 'Hello!')` |
| `io.emit()` | 📢 Broadcast to all | `io.emit('alert', 'Lunch!')` |
| `io.to().emit()` | 📤 Send to a room | `io.to('room1').emit('msg', 'Hi room!')` |

### Rooms Explained
- Like clubhouses for groups of friends
- Join with `socket.join('roomName')`
- Leave with `socket.leave('roomName')`
